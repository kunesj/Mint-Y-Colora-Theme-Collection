How to build themes yourself
----------------------------

1. Prepare code and data for theme generation

git clone https://github.com/kunesj/Mint-Y-Colora-Theme.git mint-themes-1.9.8

cp Mint-Y-Colora-Theme/*.py mint-themes/
cd mint-themes/
./0-install-tools.sh
```

2. Define theme colors (in `themes.json`)
```
{
    "Smoke": {"light": "A1A1A1", "dark": "A1A1A1"},
    "Majestic": {"light": "5F5F5F", "dark": "5F5F5F"}
}
```
Last line must NOT have `,` at the end!

3. Generate theme(s)
```
./autobuild-themes.py
```

For more details read README in `Mint-Y-Colora-Theme` repo.


Used colors
-----------
Used theme colors are located in file `themes.json` in my `Mint-Y-Colora-Theme` repo.

Most colors are taken from old `Mint-Y-Colora-Theme-Collection`, by looking at these lines:
```
Mint-Y-*/cinnamon/cinnamon.css
	.cinnamon-link { color: personaldarkcolour }
	.cinnamon-link:hover { color: personallightcolour }
```

`Mint-Y-Numix` theme from old `Mint-Y-Colora-Theme-Collection` was renamed to `Mint-Y-Numix-Orange` and replaced by my own version.
I have done this because it's colors are different from old verson of Numix theme I was using for last 4 years.
Deal with it.
